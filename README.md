This is a collection of some of the chess engine projects I have been iterating on for the past 5 years. Unfortunately, this is not very organized and I'm not sure if everything still works or is included here.
# About
Chess engine development has been a major passion of mine. Back in 2019 my firt python project was attempting to build a neural network from scratch using only standard libraries. The limitation of most of these engines is that they are built in python. System level languages are a much better choice for this sort of application, and is what I am working on now.

# Projects include:
- A tensorflow based neural network that trained by scraping thousands of games from my personal chess.com account. The plan was to make a bot that played like me.
- A "agrobot" designed to aggressively move pieces towards the opponents king
- A minimax based engine using search. This one was quite strong but unable to beat me.
- Experiments with binary representation of board state and chess bitboards. 
# Future plans
I plan to release better versions that I am currently developing. I am migrating one I was building in C to the rust language. I intended to build a chess engine optimized for play against human opponents. I think this would be a useful tool for learning how to exploit weaknesses in human play.
